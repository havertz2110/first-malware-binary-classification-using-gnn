malware detection using gnn (as ur malware listed in csv)

Using simple structure that containing only 2 GCN layers, i made this homemade model for binary classification task :) been saying that, its result was significant high as shown below (I used the highest result):

About the entire work, I had noted them in the ```.ipynb``` file. And if you are wondering about processing part, I have reduced data by 10 times (or more or less) because of lack of powerful hardware (about the specs, I used only free version of GG Colab). One more time, have been saying that it is for only binary classfication but if u fix a little bit in the code, we can turn this to multiclassification (I tested and it turned out to be quite acceptable).

For future direction, Im intending to add some more modules in order to improve the efficiency(MLP stuffs, DGL Stuffs, creating real .plt file, optimize or change the layer type). Fortunately, my brother as well as my supervisor had some good words on this so I felt kinda motivated :) 

Sorry for my bad english and thanks for reading till here <3 

P/s: Feel free to use this for your purpose :) I know it is not good enough to do anything and kinda funny and silly if u have deep look in this (please tell me if u find anything wrong and weird, and if possible, please teach me how to improve it) but it is my first time creating something relate to GNN.
